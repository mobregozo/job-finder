# Working Abroad/Remotely 

This is a place where I am planning to store and collect, places where I can check for openings when looking for a new gig.

So, for those that are looking for new challenges, here it is, hope it helps!


- [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/): It sounds trivial or redundant, but it is one of the first places where companies post their open positions.

- [Honeypot](https://www.honeypot.io/): Platform that let's you create your profile that companies can review. Only Europe.

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs): One of my favourits, specially because of the filterings and the alert system they have.

- [Who's hiring](https://whoishiring.io/): Love the website! It is an interative map where you can see the rate of jobs for an specific region on the map.

- [Relocate](https://relocate.me/): Specially when looking for a reloaction. 

- [Remotive](https://remotive.io/): Specific for remote options.
